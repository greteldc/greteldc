- 👋 Hi, I’m @greteldc 
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, data science and machine learning.
- 🌱 I have recently made a big step forward in broadening my knowledge in data analysis, data science and machine learning through an intensive bootcamp in Data Science (The Bridge, Madrid (online)) and am still continuing to get better by learning.
- I am currently working as a data scientist.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating on data analysis, data science and/or machine learning.
