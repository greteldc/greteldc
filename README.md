- 👋 Hi, I’m @greteldc 
- 👀 I’m interested in linguistics, data analysis, data science and machine learning.
- 🌱 I have broadened my knowledge in data analysis, data science and machine learning through an intensive bootcamp in Data Science (The Bridge, Madrid (4 months, 480h, online)).

- 💞️ I’m looking forward to continue broadening my knowledge on data analysis, data science and/or machine learning.
